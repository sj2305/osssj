# 05 - Notes

## Syntax

Notes are written in [GitHub-Flavored Markdown]
(https://guides.github.com/features/
mastering-markdown), so you can write emojis(':joy:' -> ðŸ˜‚),~~strikethrough~~ text etc.
in a familar fashion, additionally you can also 
write subscripts~example~, superscripts^example^
and footnotes[^1]

[^1]: This is a footnote, you don't need to
manually write it at the bottom of the document.

This also means that your notes aren't locked
into any proprietary format.
